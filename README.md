# Musical interval trainer

This little Python program can be used to train your ears to detect musical intervals across two octaves. 

Before running the program, please download the SoundFront file [here](https://member.keymusician.com/Member/FluidR3_GM/FluidR3_GM.zip) and place it wherever you like. Change the path to the file in the python script.

Have fun!
